Create an Excel template that allows the user to select an employee by employee​ ID, enter the number of regular hours and overtime hours​ worked, and display a payroll summary with the employee​ name, gross​ pay, federal​ tax, state​ tax, Social​ Security, Medicare withholding​ deductions, and net pay. Assume the federal tax rate is 10​%, the state tax rate is 1.227​%, Social security withholding is 6.9​%, and Medicare withholding is 1.36​%. Use a form control to select the employee ID.​ (Hint: Use the CONCATENATE function to join the first and last name in the​ template.)\n",
