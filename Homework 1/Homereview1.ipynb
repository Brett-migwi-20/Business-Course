    "One of the earliest operations research groups during World War II was conducting a study on the optimum utilization of Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft during the Battle of Britain. Whenever one of these planes returned from​ battle, the locations of the bullet holes on it were carefully plotted. By repeatedly recording these data over​ time, and studying the clusters of​ data, the group was able to estimate the regions of the aircraft most likely to be hit by enemy​ gunfire, with the objective of reinforcing these regions with special armor. What difficulties are involved with this​ study?\n",

    "The accompanying table shows all of the items available to a hiker that will aid their hike out of the wilderness. Containers of food and water provide​ energy, shelter will protect the hiker from the​ elements, and defense will protect the hiker from wild animals. Each item has a weight and survival points. The hiker must take one item from each of the four categories​ (food, water,​ shelter, defense).​ Unfortunately, the​ hiker's backpack has a maximum capacity of 33 lbs. The​ hiker's chance for survival is calculated by adding all of the survival points together from the chosen items. What is the maximum chance for survival the hiker can​ achieve?"
